Requires git lfs for cloning. zip downloads works as usual.
Requires steam running in the background while launching the game for multiplayer to work properly.
For the linux build, you either have to use the file explorer gui to set the "DarkBros.x86_64" to a runnable program, and click it, or use the terminal to run it.
For windows, just run the "MultiplayerProject.exe" file.
